### About Pixel Planet (AKA Redhood Game V2)

There are still other map layouts to add and enemy sprites to implement into the game. For now, please enjoy "shopping" around in the Old Town Market!

### About Mobile

Though responsive in design, game play for mobile is yet to be fully supported. It is recommended to play on at least a tablet or pc.

Once fully supported, it'll be stated here.


### Thank You!

Thanks for checking out my mini game! And to those in the itch.io community, thank you for creating free animation sheets and tiles to help indie creators like me.
